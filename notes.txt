Steps to generate set of rules:
1. Generate subject, object and environment attributes
2. Generate a set of values for each of these attributes
3. Generate a set of rules from the existing set of attribute-value pairs
4. Generate a set of users with user attributes that satisfy some of these rules, while ensuring that we don't include users that don't satisfy even one of 
   these rules
5. Create an Access Control Matrix(ACM) from the given set of rules

Elaborating Step 3:
- No user can have the same set of attributes
- No rule is duplicated in the ABAC Policy
- No object can have the same set of attributes
- We do not consider environmental attributes during the policy mining process
- Same operation cannot be assigned to objects and subjects having the same attributes (ie. the same rule)
- A rule is a conjunction of subject and object attribute-value pairs

Difficulty in generating rules first and then assigning users and objects:
- 

Change in approach:
First generate a set of subjects (m), followed by set of objects (n)
Total number of rules = m * n = Total number of cells in the ACM, ie. for each subject and object pair, we have an operation defined

Statistics related to the code:
No. of possible rules
No. of possible subjects
No. of possible objects
Time associated with generating individual/group data in code (Initially, we follow a brute-force approach after which we optimize)
